# Development

## Starting the server for development.

1. Run `yarn watch` to build and watch all resources and start socket api server.
2. Run `yarn start` to start the server in another terminal.

## Creating New Resources

Use `yarn create-resource [resourceName]` to create a new resource. It will use the `_boilerplate` resource as a template.
examples:

```shell
yarn create-resource moonshine
yarn create-resource [core]/doors
```
